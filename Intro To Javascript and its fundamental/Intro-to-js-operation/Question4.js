// Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts important?

// In JavaScript, operators have precedence and associativity rules that determine the order in which they are evaluated in expressions. Precedence defines the priority of operators, and higher precedence operators are evaluated first. Associativity comes into play when multiple operators with the same precedence appear in an expression; it defines the order in which they are evaluated, either left-to-right or right-to-left.

// Understanding these concepts is important for writing expressions that produce the intended results. Without a clear understanding of operator precedence and associativity, expressions may be evaluated in unexpected ways, leading to errors or incorrect outcomes.

// For example, consider the expression `a + b * c`. The multiplication operator (`*`) has higher precedence than the addition operator (`+`), so `b * c` is evaluated first. If the precedence were different, and addition had higher precedence, the expression would be evaluated as `(a + b) * c`, potentially producing a different result.

// Similarly, associativity affects the order of evaluation when operators with the same precedence appear in an expression. For instance, the assignment operator (`=`) has right-to-left associativity, so expressions like `a = b = c` are evaluated from right to left, with the value of `c` assigned to both `b` and `a`.

// In summary, understanding operator precedence and associativity is crucial for writing correct and predictable JavaScript code. It ensures that expressions are evaluated in the intended order, preventing potential errors and ensuring the proper functioning of the program.
