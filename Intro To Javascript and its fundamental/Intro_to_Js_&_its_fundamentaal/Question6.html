<!-- Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability. -->

Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for code readability and maintainability. Clear and expressive identifiers convey the purpose of the variable, making it easier for developers (including yourself and others) to understand the code without extensive comments. Meaningful variable names enhance the readability of the code, reduce the likelihood of errors, and make debugging and troubleshooting more straightforward.

For example, consider the following code snippet with poorly and well-named variables:

Poorly Named Variables:

let x = 10; // What does x represent?
let y = 5;  // What does y represent?
let z = x + y; // What does z signify?


Well-Named Variables:

let numberOfApples = 10;
let numberOfOranges = 5;
let totalFruits = numberOfApples + numberOfOranges;


In the poorly named version, it's unclear what `x`, `y`, and `z` represent, making it challenging to grasp the purpose of the variables and the calculation being performed. In the well-named version, descriptive variable names (`numberOfApples`, `numberOfOranges`, and `totalFruits`) provide clear context. Anyone reading the code can easily understand that the variables represent quantities of fruits and the purpose of the calculation.

By consistently choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names, developers can create more understandable, maintainable, and error-resistant JavaScript code, facilitating collaboration and long-term code sustainability.
