<!-- Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and multi-line comments. -->

Comments in JavaScript serve as a way to include non-executable text within the code, providing explanations, documentation, or reminders for developers. They are essential for improving code readability, maintaining codebase documentation, and facilitating collaboration among team members. Comments are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter during the execution of the code, making them purely for human understanding.

Here are examples of single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript:

<!-- This is a single-line comment
let age = 25;  Variable storing the age of a person -->

<!-- 
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can cover several lines of text.
  Multi-line comments are useful for more detailed explanations.
 -->
let fullName = "John Doe";
