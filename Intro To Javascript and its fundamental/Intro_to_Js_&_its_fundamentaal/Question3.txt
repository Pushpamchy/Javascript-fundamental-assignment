<!-- List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript. -->

String:

The string data type represents sequences of characters and is used to store text or numbers. Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.

Number:

The number data type represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

Boolean:

The boolean data type has only two possible values: true or false. It is often used for conditional statements and logical operations.

Undefined:

The undefined data type is used for variables that have been declared but not yet assigned a value.

Null:

The null data type represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable has no value.
