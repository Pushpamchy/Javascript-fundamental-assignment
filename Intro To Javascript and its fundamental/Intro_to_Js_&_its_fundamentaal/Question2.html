JavaScript and HTML are both essential components of web development, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here are the key differences between JavaScript and HTML, along with examples of situations where each is commonly used:

JavaScript

Purpose:-

JavaScript is a programming language used for adding interactivity, dynamic behavior, and logic to web pages. It allows for the creation of responsive and interactive user interfaces.
Examples of Use:

Form Validation: JavaScript can be used to validate user input in forms before submitting them to the server. For instance, checking if an email address is in the correct format.
Dynamic Content: JavaScript is often employed to update or modify the content of a webpage dynamically without requiring a full page reload. For example, displaying real-time data updates.
Event Handling: Responding to user interactions, such as clicks, keypresses, or mouse movements, is a common use of JavaScript to trigger specific actions on a webpage.
Syntax:

JavaScript has a more complex syntax than HTML, involving variables, functions, control structures, and objects.]

<!--  Example of JavaScript code
function greetUser(name) {
  alert("Hello, " + name + "!");
} -->


HTML:-
Purpose:-

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the web. It defines the structure of a webpage using elements and tags.
Examples of Use:

Document Structure: HTML is used to define the overall structure of a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements.
Text and Media: HTML is responsible for displaying text, images, videos, and other media content on a webpage.
Links and Navigation: HTML is used to create hyperlinks that allow users to navigate between different pages on the web.
Syntax:

HTML uses a simple and straightforward syntax based on tags. Tags are used to define elements, and they are enclosed in angle brackets.

Example of HTML code
<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
  <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
</body>
</html> -->
