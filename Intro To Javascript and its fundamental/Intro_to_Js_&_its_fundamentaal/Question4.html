<!-- What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the 'let' keyword? -->

The purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript is to reserve a space in memory to store data that can be manipulated or referenced in a program. Variables act as named containers for values, allowing developers to work with and manage data more effectively. Declaring variables is a fundamental aspect of programming, enabling the storage and retrieval of information during the execution of a script or program.

In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the let keyword. The let keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and is commonly used for variable declaration in modern JavaScript.

Here's an example of how to declare variables using the let keyword

<!--  Variable declaration
let firstName;

 Variable assignment
firstName = "John";

Variable declaration and assignment in one step
let lastName = "Doe";

 Variables can be reassigned
lastName = "Smith"; -->
